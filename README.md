# Surfs_up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to gather data for surfing conditions and ice cream weather in Oahu Hawaii to determine the temperatures and precipitation throughout the months of the year. We create new dependencies then use Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, SQLite, and SQL Alchemy to retrieve the requested data. Using visual studio code we were able to create routes in the command terminal to run the flask app function to generate results to share on a webpage such as an API call.

## Results
By writing a query to filter the summer temperatures of June in Oahu we can gather the summary statistics of the temperatures for the requested month. The describe function allows us to display the moonth of June's overall observation count, average temperatures, deviations, minimum temperatures, and maximum temperatures.

  * There 1700 observations of temperature changes for the month.
  * The average temperature for June was about 74 degrees.
  * The minimum recorded temperature was 64 degrees.
  * the highest temperatures for June hit about 85 degrees

We then write another query to generate the summary statistics for temperatures in Oahu for the winter month of December. In the image below has information in the same  format that looks quite similar with new data pertaining to the December data requested.

  * There 1517 observations of temperature changes for the month.
  * The average temperature for December was about 71 degrees.
  * The temperatures are lower in the winter coming in at a minimun of 56 degrees.
  * the highest temperatures are relatively the same reaching about 83 degrees.

## Summary 
The temperature in Oahu is consistanly the same for all of the months throughout the year with the low temperatures fluctuating between the summer and winter months. The precipitation is very similiar between the months as well. The results show that Oahu is a good location to open a surf and ice cream shop with little change in climate to effect any business routine.

Below are precipitaction summary statistic images generated in the describe function format and are related to the June and December months.
