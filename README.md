# Surfs_up

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to gather data for surfing conditions and ice cream weather in Oahu Hawaii to determine the temperatures and precipitation throughout the months of the year. We create new dependencies then use Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code, SQLite, and SQL Alchemy to retrieve the requested data. Using visual studio code we were able to create routes in the command terminal to run the flask app function to generate results to share on a webpage such as an API call.

## Results
By writing a query to filter the summer temperatures of June in Oahu we can gather the summary statistics of the temperatures for the requested month. The describe function allows us to display the moonth of June's overall observation count, average temperatures, deviations, minimum temperatures, and maximum temperatures.

  * There 1700 observations of temperature changes for the month.
  * The average temperature for June was about 74 degrees.
  * The minimum recorded temperature was 64 degrees.
  * the highest temperature for June hit about 85 degrees
